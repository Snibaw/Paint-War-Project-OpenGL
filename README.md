# Paint War-Project OpenGL
 
A school project in a group of three involved creating an OpenGL-based 3D paint war game. We implemented techniques such as Ray-Marching to display players on the screen and simulate physics interactions between the players' blobs. This project served as a significant learning experience, as it was our first game in OpenGL!
